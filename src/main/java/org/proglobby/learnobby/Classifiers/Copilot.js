//dude i don't understand basic english
//okaaay
// js is so stupid you can do
a=3;
b="3";
console.log(b+a);
//found it  the run
//run this
//yes
//i think they fixed it it was supposed to return 6 when we do a+b
//cuz the frist one is int
//it's about floating wch ismo ?
//vergule flotant
//fi SM 9rina how to convert numbers with , to Binary
//so sometimes we will have an infinity 1 and 0 after ,
//that's the problem of stupid JS

//lemme remember the example
// if (0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3) {
//     console.log('0.1 + 0.2 is exactly equal to 0.3');
// }
// else {
//     console.log("nigaaaaaaa")
// }
if (0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3) {
    console.log('0.1 + 0.2 is exactly equal to 0.3');
}else{
    console.log("nigaaaaaaa")
}
if (NaN==null) {
    console.log("hey Nigga")
} else if (NaN>null){
    console.log("wassup nigga")
} else if (NaN<null){
    console.log("niggos hola")
}
else if (NaN!=null){
    console.log("Heil Hitler")
